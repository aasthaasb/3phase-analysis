# 3phasesystem-analysis
Overview

This project is a simulator for three-phase power systems implemented in Python using the Streamlit framework. The simulator allows users to analyze different types of three-phase connections (Y-Y, Y-D, D-Y, D-D) and calculate phase and line voltages.
Features

    Connection Types: Supports Y-Y, Y-D, D-Y, and D-D three-phase connections.
    Voltage Calculations: Calculates phase and line voltages based on user input.
    Interactive Interface: Provides an interactive interface for easy configuration and analysis.
    Real-Time Feedback: Displays simulation results in real-time for immediate analysis.

Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your_username/three-phase-system-simulator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd three-phase-system-simulator

Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Run the Streamlit app:

    arduino

    streamlit run app.py

    Open the provided URL in your web browser to access the simulator.

    Configure the three-phase system by selecting the connection type and adjusting the input sliders.

    View the simulation results, including phase and line voltages, in real-time.

    Analyze the results to verify calculations or experiment with different configurations.
